## About 
I work on artificial intelligence research and development at Apple with a focus on natural language processing (NLP). In 2019, I took a degree in applied mathematics from UC Berkeley.

I previously served as the UC Student Advisor, a nonvoting member of the Regents of the University of California. During my term, I represented over 270,000 students and other stakeholders on the Board.  

My research interests have led me to work with NASA, the Santa Fe Institute and UC Berkeley on topics in biology, mathematics, and computer science. My ongoing projects are focused on multi-domain data selection in NLP and synergy theory in radiobiology.
