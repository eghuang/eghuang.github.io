I am a new graduate in applied mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley. 

I most recently served as the UC Student Advisor, a nonvoting member of the Regents of the University of California. During my term, I represented over 250,000 students and additional stakeholders of the University as the sole undergraduate on the Board.

Since 2017, I've worked on radiation biology with the Sachs research group at UC Berkeley. During the 2018 - 2019 academic year, I collaborated with NASA Ames on a deep learning project for satellite imagery. In summer 2018, I worked on Turing machine theory and Kolmogorov complexity as an REU at the Santa Fe Institute. From 2015 to 2017, I worked on evolutionary ecology with with EvoLab in the Department of ESPM at UC Berkeley.

Outside of academics, I was formerly the Acting President of the Cal Hiking and Outdoor Society, a member of Cal Boxing, and a brand ambassador for the outdoor company Kl√§ttermusen.
