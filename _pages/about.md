I'm a software engineer working in artificial intelligence and machine learning at Apple. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in applied mathematics in 2019.

Previously, I was the UC Student Advisor, a nonvoting member of the Regents of the University of California. During my term, I served over 270,000 students and additional stakeholders of the University as the undergraduate representative on the Board.

I have a strong interest in scientific research - I've worked with NASA, the Santa Fe Institute, and UC Berkeley on several topics within biology, mathematics, and computer science.
