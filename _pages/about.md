I'm a software engineer working on artificial intelligence and machine learning at Apple. In 2019, I recieved my B.A. in applied mathematics from UC Berkeley.

I was previously the UC Student Advisor, a nonvoting member of the Regents of the University of California. During my term, I served over 270,000 students and additional stakeholders of the University as the undergraduate representative on the Board.

My research interests have led me to work with NASA, the Santa Fe Institute, and UC Berkeley on topics in biology, mathematics, and computer science. More details are available on my Google Scholar and GitHub pages.
