I"õ<p>Iâ€™m a software engineer working on artificial intelligence and machine learning at Apple. In 2019, I recieved my BA in applied mathematics from UC Berkeley.</p>

<p>I was previously the UC Student Advisor, a nonvoting member of the Regents of the University of California. During my term, I served over 270,000 students and additional stakeholders as the undergraduate representative on the Board.</p>

<p>My research interests have led me to work with NASA, the Santa Fe Institute and UC Berkeley on topics in biology, mathematics, and computer science. More details are available on my Google Scholar and GitHub pages.</p>

<!---*tufte-css-jekyll* is a theme based on [*tufte-css*](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css), which in turn implements the design ideas of Edward Tufte in CSS, and [*tufte-jekyll*](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) (but tries to stick more closely to the original tufte-css styles than the latter).

Note that this is a full-width layout. This was accomplished by including ```layout: full-width``` in the YAML front matter for this page, i.e., no sidenotes or marginnotes! 

If you want to know what Tufte style comprises, have a look at the [Tufte CSS](./page/) page.--->
