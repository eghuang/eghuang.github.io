Synergy analysis uses the dose-effect relations (DERs) of mixture components to define a baseline mixture DER characterizing absence of  synergy/antagonism. We here discuss a recently introduced replacement, incremental effect additivity. We exemplify incremental effect additivity by discussing the mixed radiation field above low earth orbit, whose components are believed to have highly curvilinear DERs for carcinogenesis.
